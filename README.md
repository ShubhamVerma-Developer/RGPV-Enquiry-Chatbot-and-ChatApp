# RGPV-Enquiry-Chatbot-and-ChatApp


The RGPV Enquiry Chatbot and ChatApp are web-based applications. The university and college enquiry chatbot project is built using artificial algorithms that analyze user queries and understand user messages. 🤖 This system is a web application that provides answers to students' queries. 📚 Students simply have to chat with the chatbot, using any format they prefer; there is no specific format required. 💬 The system searches the database for the query and provides relevant answers. 🔍 The answers are appropriate to the user's queries. Users can inquire about any college-related activities through the system, eliminating the need to personally visit the college for enquiries. 🏫 The system analyzes the questions and provides answers to the users as if they were answered by a person. 💡 Responses are provided using an effective Graphical User Interface (GUI), including text, images, and tables, giving the impression of a real person interaction. 🖼️ Users only need to register and login to the system to access various help pages. 📝 These help pages include the chatbot, where users can inquire about college activities. Users can query activities such as the date and timing of annual day, sports day, and other cultural activities, as well as other information-related queries. 🗓️ This system helps students stay updated about college activities. Another module of the project is the ChatApp for chatting with other users. 💬 It displays user statuses as online or offline. 🔵 Passwords are stored in the database in encrypted format, and OTP verification is used to verify users' Gmail accounts. ✅ Admin users can maintain and update the database, as well as manage users. 👩‍💼🔧
